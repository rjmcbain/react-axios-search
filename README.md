## Description
Simple React app that connects with the Unsplash Api and searches through photos via the search bar.

Users are able to search for things like cars or plants. That data gets sent to Unsplash through an axios call and retrieves information related to the keyword provided.

Since each image is a different height and width the images are being styled through Grid CSS.
